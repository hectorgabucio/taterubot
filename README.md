# Taterubot - Discord bot to record and send audios ("Whatsapp way")

## How it works
This simple bot creates a voice channel in your Discord. If you enter that channel, the bot will follow you. Speak with him and leave the channel. The bot will upload the audio file to the server.

# Requirements
- Node.js > 16
- ffmpeg

# Run locally
1. Create .env file (following .env.example format) and put your bot token there.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to build and start the bot.
